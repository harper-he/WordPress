Website update:
4 new pages are live. Productivity, Safety, Training, and the Location/Contact tracing pages.  Use case pages for the Productivity, Safety, & Training, still need to be created.  This could add 9 more pages (3 each). 
A banner was also added to the top to highlight our contact tracing solutions
A few updates to the menu bar
Advisors were updated.
In the backend: Hubspot plugin was installed.  This still needs to be configured…but will be useful for when we send marketing emails via hubspot.
Let me know here….in this thread…if you find any issues.  Just tag me, so I get an alert.
Finally, big big shoutout to @Harper (whose last day was yesterday; she will be back in June).  Harper worked long days to get this finished.  She accomplished much in her short time with us….despite a couple setbacks.  Thanks Harper!
