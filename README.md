Website update:<br>
4 new pages are live. Productivity, Safety, Training, and the Location/Contact tracing pages.  <br>
Use case pages for the Productivity, Safety, & Training, still need to be created.  This could add 9 more pages (3 each). <br>
A banner was also added to the top to highlight our contact tracing solutions<br>
A few updates to the menu bar<br>
Advisors were updated.<br>
In the backend: Hubspot plugin was installed.  This still needs to be configured…but will be useful for when we send marketing emails via hubspot.<br>

Finally, big big shoutout to @Harper (whose last day was yesterday; she will be back in June).  Harper worked long days to get this finished.  She accomplished much in her short time with us….despite a couple setbacks.  Thanks Harper!
