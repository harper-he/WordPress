# WordPress

Website update:<br>
4 new pages are live. Productivity, Safety, Training, and the Location/Contact tracing pages.  <br>
Use case pages for the Productivity, Safety, & Training, still need to be created.  This could add 9 more pages (3 each). <br>
A banner was also added to the top to highlight our contact tracing solutions<br>
A few updates to the menu bar<br>
Advisors were updated.<br>
In the backend: Hubspot plugin was installed.  This still needs to be configured…but will be useful for when we send marketing emails via hubspot.<br>

Finally, big big shoutout to @Harper (whose last day was yesterday; she will be back in June).  Harper worked long days to get this finished.  She accomplished much in her short time with us….despite a couple setbacks.  Thanks Harper! 

HUGE SHOUTOUT to @Harper and @Matt Kempler to get our website almost ready to launch!!!!<br>
Thanks @channel for the  wonderful emojis.  A few comments:<br>
This is a work in progress.  Its not perfect yet but most things that need to be corrected only Harper and I know.<br>
We published live the new 1) Home page, 2) Platform Overview, 3) Delta-1, & 4) Dashboard.<br>
The old Software Platform page redirects to Dashboard :+1:<br>
The  Training page is almost done, and we’ll use that as a template to create the Safety and Productivity pages<br>
We are also working on a Location Tracking and Contact Tracing page.  Some graphics are being created.  Stay tuned.<br>
We linked Google Tag Manager and Search Console, though we are not sure exactly how to use them yet.<br>
We are now taking iterative backups daily.  Before no backups.  Wasn’t safe.  Pun intended.<br>
We also updated SEO on the new pages. <br>
